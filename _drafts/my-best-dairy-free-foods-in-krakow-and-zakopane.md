title: My best Dairy Free foods in Krakow and Zakopane

---
I have just been on a holiday in Poland in Krakow and Zakopane. I am now blogging to tell you about my favourite foods in Krakow and the Big Z. The foods I am recommending are Dairy Free because I am a DF cool kid. (I am 8 now and I have not done a blog post in a while because I have just published a cook book called 'Things on Sticks' - you can buy it here: [https://martha.ellis.scot/things-on-sticks-cookbook/](https://martha.ellis.scot/things-on-sticks-cookbook/ "https://martha.ellis.scot/things-on-sticks-cookbook/")).
