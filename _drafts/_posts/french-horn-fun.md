I thought that it might be interesting to learn how to play French horn because my auntie Lisa is a French horn player. She is really good and I want to be good like her. The French horn is a brass instrument and it's cool. It's heavy and big. Mine is smaller than normal because it's a mini horn which is easier for beginners to practice on. This video is me showing off my first tune. I described the parts of the horn and the stand and the book. French horn is fun.
