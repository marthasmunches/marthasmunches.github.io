I made this. We took it to my friend's house. We played and had tea there. There was lots of Apple Frangipane cake for afters.

I saw this cake on Mary Berry on TV in my Granny's house. But it had dairy in it. There was lots of butter. So we used coconut oil and margarine instead and made this one.

It was very very good. We did a fan of apples.

We had a rolling pin to bash up the biscuitsÂ
