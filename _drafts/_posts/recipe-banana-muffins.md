Hello! Martha here, reporting banana muffins.

2 banana muffins on a plate, in my tummy soon

I made them, because I wanted to put something else on my blog. I made them after breakfast and we had them for morning snack. I chose bananas because they are one of my favourite fruits, and we had some. They don't have any dairy in them. They were easy to make and we used one fork and one spoon and one bowl. I sprinkled gorilla (granola) on top to make it crunchy. My Mum has written the recipe for me (and you).

<div>Ingredients (makes 6)</div>

<div>
<ul>
<li>1 medium banana</li>
<li>1 small egg</li>
<li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
<li>3 tbsp sugar</li>
<li>6 tbsp self raising flour</li>
<li>3 tbsp granola</li>
</ul>
<div>Preheat the oven to 160C fan (180C) and put 6 cake cases in a bun tin.</div>
<div>First mash the banana in a bowl. Crack in the egg and oil and beat. Mix in the sugar, then add the self raising flour and stir until well combined.&nbsp;</div>
</div>

<div>Spoon into the cake cases and sprinkle 1/2 tbsp of the granola on top of each.</div>

<div>Bake for 15-20 minutes until risen and golden.</div>

<div>Remove from tins and cool on a wire rack.</div>

They were very good for snack. I gave them 7 thumbs up out of ten.</div>
<div>Next time I would add dried mango or chocolate chips to the mixture. My Daddy suggested caramel sauce. Mum suggested walnuts.</div><p><br></p><img src="/uploads/2017/08/09/2016-01-23%2009.42.55.jpg">
