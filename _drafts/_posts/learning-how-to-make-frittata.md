(1) tear your carbahidrat into a cake tin (carbohydrate - bread, potato, pasta) - I used bread

(2) crack six eggs into a bowl and pick out the shell

(3) season with salt and pepper and add a splash of oatmilk then whisk

(4) add some flavour of your choice to the bread I chose some leftover beef and vegtble curry
