For my home learning I had to lern a life skill and I chose to Â cook frittata.

It was delicious and healthy.

(1) tear your carbahidrat into a cake tin (carbohydrate - bread, potato, pasta) - I used bread

(2) crack six eggs into a bowl and pick out the shell

(3) season with salt and pepper and add a splash of oatmilk then whisk

(4) add some flavour of your choice to the bread I chose some leftover beef and vegtble curry

(5) tip the egg into the tin and cook for 30mins at 170C in the oven

Bits I have to improve are cracking eggs.

Flavours that I want to try next time are one sweet and one savoury.

The savoury one first is chicken, tomato and pasta. The sweet one is pain au chocolate and mango.
