Me and my friend Chiara made a stop-motion video. It used PlayMobil, a rubber, playdough, 6 books and my mum's Sony camera. We took lots of photos, moving the people between each photo. We turned the photos into 2 films. We changed the props between the films. 

The first film was a comedy snowbording one

The second film was a fort love store
