So in the car park in Fort William Martha went on a pretend drive to see Uncle Paul. According to her commentary, she was keeping her eyes open for bunnies and seals, and saw a sea urchin over there. After the drive was over, Martha helped herself to a pair of boxers from Jono's bag on the ground leading to this slightly surreal exclamation "Martha I'd rather you didn't rub my pants into that vans bumper, or any bumper for that matter!" Life with Martha is never dull. Sometimes bizarre, but never dull!</span></div>
