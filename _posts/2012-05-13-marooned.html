Today has been a day of soggy bee keeping for Jono with more theory and fewer real bees, who are not big rain fans! Martha and have survived. Martha has copied me exactly saying 'Oh my God' in response to the volume of cake crumbs she managed to create all over herself and the carseat, whilst i tried to get enough 3G signal to get on the met office and Cal Mac websites! We stopped at one point during another double lap of the island sleep fail drive, for me to retrieve her caterpillar blanket. She wanted out. I said no. We drove on and a minute or so later i accidentally put the car into first instead of third. It revved and slowed, unsurprisingly, and i said 'Sorry Martha'. The voice from the back said, with a hint of bitterness... 'Sorry Martha, not getting out'. Hopefully i'll be forgiven by tomorrow!</span></div>
