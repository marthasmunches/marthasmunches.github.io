This is me with my lunch

This is the chocolate mousse… but you can't see the avocado!

Where we went: [Martha's in Glasgow](http://www.mymarthas.co.uk/)

<div>What meal did we go for: lunch</div>

<div>Companions: MARTHA and mum</div>

<div>What we ate: wrap with falafel, chocolate mousse, rhubarb compote and sparkling cordial</div>

<div>The review:</div>

<div>I liked the fizzy cordial. The secret ingredient in the chocolate mousse was avocado… but it didn't taste like avocado! It tasted sweet and had seeds on it. The cafe had the same name as me and I like that. The lady behind the counter was nice - she gave me a lot of stickers… and they all say my name on them! (And they are different colours).&nbsp;</div>

<div>There were lots of things that were dairy-free that I could choose from. It was easy to know what was in things because they had the ingredients written on them. My friend Isabella could have eaten there too, because they also had things that were gluten-free. If I went back again then I'd like to have a rice and chicken box with coleslaw. I would like to take my DAD because he was working.</div>

<div>How many thumbs up: 10 out of 10&nbsp;</div>

<div>[During the writing of this post, Martha discovered the Shift key, and capitals….]</div>
