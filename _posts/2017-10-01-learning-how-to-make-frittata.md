Bits I have to improve are cracking eggs.

Flavours that I want to try next time are one sweet and one savoury.

The savoury one first is chicken, tomato and pasta. The sweet one is pain au chocolate and mango.

I typed up to the end of the recipe and then my mum typed the last four lines whilst I said the words.
