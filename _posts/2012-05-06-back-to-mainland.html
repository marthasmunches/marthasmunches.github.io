Due to a very scenic detour we made the ferry by the skin of our teeth - it added an extra level of distress to the hairpin bends,blind summits, passing places and 14 percent hills! Since the car thermometer has been above 5 most of the day, we're camping again tonight near Arisaig. Keep your fingers crossed it stays above freezing tonight...</span></div>
