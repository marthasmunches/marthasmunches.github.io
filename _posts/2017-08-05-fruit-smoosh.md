I decided to make smoothies today.

We looked in books. We wrote down ingredients. We missed out the spinach. Then Dad went to get it while I was at dance.

When I got back I had lunch then I made smoothies.

Strawberry, Banana, Mango and Peach smoothie served with physalis shaped like flowers (serves 3)

1) get 6 of your strawberries  chop the top off (ps careful knives are sharp thank you xxx)

2) get your adult to chop a mango or chop it yourself if you are an adult

3) peel and chop a banana

4) put them all in a blender or hand blender as we did it

5) pour in some peach juice and some oat milk or other milk

6) blend, blend, blend

7) pour it into glasses
