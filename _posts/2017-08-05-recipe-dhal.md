Today I made dhal. This is not the same as Roald Dahl. It is d-h-a-l not d-a-h-l.
Dhal is from India and it is made of lentils.
Somebody also made it on Masterchef.
It is very healthy because it has vegetables in it.

We ate it with bread (chapatti), and rice and salmon curry.

I think it was 10 out of 10. Next time I would not put the courgette in. I would do the same recipe but with no courgette.
