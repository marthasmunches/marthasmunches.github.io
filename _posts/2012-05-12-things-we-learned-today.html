That if you're going to do laundry about a mile walk away, it's a good idea to check you've remember detergent before you set off. And that almost 2yr old toddlers that don't want to walk are very heavy but also very open to shameless bribery with bourbon biscuits. Things Martha learned... That geese eat grass. That there is a bird called a corn crake which makes a funny croaky sound. That small hands can't hold a stick, two stones, a pine cone and some daisies without dropping some or all of them repeatedly. That sand is fun to throw until the wind changes direction suddenly. And Jono learned lots about bees!</span></div>
