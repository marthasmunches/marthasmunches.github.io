<div>Where we went:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bodabar.com/akva/">Akva</a></div>

<div>What meal did we go for: lunch</div>

<div>Companions: Martha, jono, ruth, and vicky</div>

<div>What we ate: French toast with banana and honey... and the grownups ate other things too</div>

<div>The review: They served me first - they did actually! It was nice being asked first. The waiter checked that everything was dairy-free (just to make sure) and they made a special French toast for me. The honey came in a tiny pot and I dunked the banana in, poured it over my toast and I was able to lick the honey from the pot at the end! [NB - activity not condoned by parents!]</div>

<div>In the toilets they had a waterfall tap and a really big sink.&nbsp;</div>

<div>The cafe was a bit cold because we were sitting near the door </div>

<div>Next time I go I want to try the other type of French toast - bacon and maple syrup!</div>

<div>How many thumbs up: 10 out of 10&nbsp;</div>
