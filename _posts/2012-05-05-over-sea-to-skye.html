This pic was taken earlier in Kyle of Lochalsh, shortly before i shamelessly bribed Martha with cherry liquorice to get back into the car and be good until we crossed the Skye bridge! Wasn't sure Martha had fully understood the bargain until we were on our way and a little voice from the back seat piped up 'Martha over there liquorice in mouth'. Yep, that pretty much sums it up!</span></div>
