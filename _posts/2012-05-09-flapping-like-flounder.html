This is Martha flapping her arms and poncho like the rays and flounders. They were a favourite, as were the seals and otters. In fact the otters were almost the lucky recipients of Jono's glasses when Martha swiped them off his face and threw them. There was a row, there were tears, but the prospect of not seeing the jellyfish meant good behaviour prevailed afterwards! Spending a night of luxury in the Oban Bay hotel tonight, the off to Colonsay in the morning.</span></div>
