Take 1 tub of DF ice-cream and 2 DF pies (I used mince pies). Crumble up the pies in a mixing bowl

Let the ice cream melt a little bit more than normal and mash it into the pies. Put it back in the freezer.

Soften to scoop or slice if you want to eat it without waiting

Close up piescream

Other flavours that I think would be nice are strawberry ice cream and bakewell tart, chocolate ice cream and cherry pie or apple tart and plain ice cream.
